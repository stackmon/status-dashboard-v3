- **Data Sorting**: Orders the availability data in descending order by year and month.
- **Response Delivery**: Returns a JSON response containing the compiled availability data.

## Request

    {
      "id": 218,
      "name": "Auto Scaling",
      "region": "EU-DE",
      "availability": [
        {
          "year": 2024,

          "percentage": 99.999666
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Function: `calculateAvailability`

### Description

Calculates the monthly availability of a component over the past year, expressed as a percentage.   
Availability is defined as the proportion of time a component was operational within a given month.

### Workflow

1. **Input Validation**:
   - Returns an error if the component is `nil`.
   - Returns `nil` if the component has no incidents.

2. **Defining the Calculation Period**:
   - Sets the end date to the current date.
   - Sets the start date to 11 months prior, covering a 12-month period.

3. **Initializing Downtime Array**:
   - Creates an array to record downtime for each month.

4. **Processing Incidents**:
   - Filters incidents to include only those with an end date and a specific impact level.
   - Adjusts incident periods to fit within the calculation timeframe.
   - Allocates downtime across relevant months, accounting for month boundaries.

5. **Calculating Monthly Availability**:
   - For each month:
     - Determines total hours in the month.
     - Calculates availability using the formula:

       ```markdown
       Availability (%) = 100% - (Downtime Hours / Total Hours in Month) Ã— 100%
       ```

     - Rounds the result to five decimal places.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Returns an array of `MonthlyAvailability` objects with year, month, and availability percentage.

### Handling Month Boundaries

The function accounts for incidents spanning multiple months by:

- **Adjusting Incident Periods**: Constrains incident times to the calculation period.
- **Distributing Downtime**: Calculates overlap with each month to allocate downtime accurately.
